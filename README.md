# stackfn-clj
A Clojure interpreter for a stack-based language.

The core of this implementation revolves around a single macro, `defstackfn`, and a handful of helper functions. Rather than creating a "calculator" function that parses the arguments and computes the result, the work performed by this interpreter deals with shifting around s-expressions to create valid Clojure code. It leaves the execution of this code up to Clojure.

## Project Structure

The work is spread across four files in the `src` folder:

- src/assertions.clj  
- src/core.clj    
- src/stack.clj
- src/utilities.clj    

The `defstackfn` definition, along with the main test case, lives in `core.clj`. The remaining functions are grouped together in files based on their functionality and the shape of data upon which they operate.

## Design Goals

A key design goal of this project is composability. Nearly all of the functions accept and return a single data type: a map with the keys `:bindings` and `:stack`. This "environment map" (`env-map`) might look like this.:
```clj
{:bindings [!a1 1 !b1 2]
 :stack    '(1 2 !a !b)}
```

A consistent data type allows functions to be broken up into small units of work. These `env-map` functions can call each other to manipulate `:bindings` and `:stack`, or can call themselves recursively. Even the central `compile>` function accepts and returns an `env-map`. While our spec for `defstackfn` calls for starting compilation with an empty `:stack`, `compile>` is free for the developer to employ in new scenarios that may benefit from passing around an existing `:stack`.

Another design goal of this implementation is transparency. An `env-map` is a simple data type, and can be inspected as its passed around functions. We delay evaluation as long as possible, and we do not resolve symbol names (e.g. `!a`) while the `env-map` is being passed around. The developer should be able to debug the `:stack` without needing to keep a mental map between `!a` and its evaluation.

This goal leads to a major implementation decision: a `defstackfn` definiton should produce valid Clojure code. A developer should be able to `macroexpand` a `defstackfn` and see familiar, readable Clojure code to aid in debugging. The execution of a `stackfn` will simply execute the expanded Clojure code. The specified testcase for `defstackfn` is below:

```clj
(defstackfn f [!a !b !c]
  !a
  !b
  (invoke> + 2)
  !v1+
  !c
  !c
  <pop>
  2
  (invoke> * 2)
  !v2+
  (invoke> = 2)
  (if>
      !v1
    !v2
    (invoke> - 2)
    else>
    "false!!"
    (invoke> println 1)
    <pop>
    !v1
    !v2
    (invoke> * 2))
  )
```

Assuming low gensym numbers, our implementation of `defstackfn` would `macroexpand` the above definition to:

```clj
(def f
 (fn*
   ([!a !b !c]
     (let*
       [!a:1  !a
        !b:2  !b
        !c:3  !c
        !v1:4 (+ !b:2 !a:1)
        !v2:5 (* 2 (do !c:3 !c:3))]
       (do
         :utilities/empty
         (if (= !v2:5 !v1:1)
           (let* [] (do :utilities/empty (- !v2:2 !v1:1)))
           (let* []
             (do
               (do (println "false!!") :utilities/empty)
               (* !v2:2 !v1:1)))))))))
```

The `!a:1` symbol format is derived from user-passed arguments concatenated with a gensym to ensure uniqueness. Real usage will have higher gensym numbers, and the implementation could be optimized for readibility by hand-rolling more friendly suffixes instead of relying on gensyms.

`compile>`, therefore, does not "evaluate", but "transpiles". It only concerns itself with symbols and lists of symbols, and has no knowledge of actual values. Its main considerations are shuffling around s-expressions, and ensuring that the forms passed to `defstackfn` will output valid Clojure code.

Our third design goal leverages the nature of a stack-based language to create highly-expressive error messages. The syntax of our `stackfn` language allows us to infer a good deal of information about the `:stack` at compile time. Before the developer can even evaluate `defstackfn`, we can make perform analysis that can alert them to unbound variables, incorrect syntax, and invalid stack heights. For an example, you can modify the third form of our test case (`(invoke> + 2)`) to cause a stack error by change it to (`(invoke> + 3)`). When you try and evaluate the surrounding `defstackfn`, an error message will helpfully point out your mistake by including the follwing `ex-info`:

```clj
   Incorrect stack height
   {:received-height 2,
    :expected-height 3,
    :position 2,
    :definition
    [(defstackfn f [!a !b !c])
     !a
     !b
     [(invoke> + 3) "â†ž Incorrect stack height"]
     !v1+
     !c
     !c
     ...
    }
```
